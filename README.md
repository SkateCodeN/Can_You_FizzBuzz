# Can_You_FizzBuzz
Since recruiters want to see how I code. Here is a basic example of FizzBuzz, to show that I can do basic programming  in C#.
Here is what the problem is:
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and 
for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates 
who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.
